# Hey, I’m Ali

##### about me:
I get bored so fast that maybe faster than an elephant runnin’ from a rat... a Jewish rat. Kidding. Relax. ...Maybe.

Started a hundred things, finished none. Unless you count hating. btw the repos are private because my dumbass didn’t know how to use env files back then. Don’t ask.

Also I've been coding for nearly 3 fuckin’ years now. at this point, i should’ve built the next Facebook type shi but Instead, I built a wooden chair. And like… two broken apps.

And if there’s one thing I like about myself, it’s that I learn fast. Real fast. But then quit faster.. F—

Sometimes i disappear for a week y’know “questioning life” type shit Then I crawl back like nothin’ happened.

and yeah. I lov pizza, The Sopranos, and of course… my famiiiglia.

Not necessarily in that order. Depends how good the pizza is.
