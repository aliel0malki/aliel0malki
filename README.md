# Hey, I’m Ali

##### about me:
I get bored so fast that maybe faster than an elephant runnin’ from a rat... a Jewish rat. Kidding. Relax. ....Maybe;

Started a hundred things, finished... none. Unless you count hating. btw they are private repos because my stupidass didn't know how to use env back then.

I been coding for nearly 3 fuckin’ years. At this point, should’ve built the next Facebook typa shi but instead I built a chair of woods. And like, two broken apps.

seriously the thing I like about myself that is, I learn fast. but quit faster. FU-

Might disappear for a week to "Questioning life" type shi
but then i come back and nothing’s change

yah and also I like pizza, nature and The Sopranos and ofc my famiiiiilia`

Not necessarily in that order. Depends how good the pizza is.

##### and for the nerds.. heres techs i likes or languages call em whatever the fuck you want
