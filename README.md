# Hey, I’m Ali

##### about me:
I get bored so fast that maybe faster than an elephant runnin’ from a rat... a Jewish rat. Kidding. Relax. ....Maybe;

Started a hundred things, finished... none. Unless you count hating.

Been coding for four fuckin’ years. At this rate, I should’ve built the next Facebook — typa shi but instead I built character. And like, two broken apps.

The thing that I like about myself? that is, I learn fast. and quit faster.

Might disappear for a week to "Questioning life" type shi
but then i come back and nothing’s change

yah and also I like pizza, nature and The Sopranos and ofc my famiiiiilia`

Not necessarily in that order. Depends how good the pizza is.

##### and for the nerds.. heres techs i likes or languages call em whatever the fuck you want
